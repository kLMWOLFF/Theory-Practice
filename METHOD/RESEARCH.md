# Habitat
In which ways can touchable embedded technology wearables (haptics) augment urban environment experiences?

**Keywords:**

        City  +  Skin  +  Fabric  +  Touch  +  Emotion + Speculative Design

**Subjects of interest:**
- The Poetics of Touch
- Bodily Relationships between the practices of wearing and feeling
- Symbiotic relationships between Skin and Fabrics
- What does it means to Inhabit a place
- Metabolic fabrics (growing materials)
- Urban social studies
- Senseable fabrics

 ### Methodology:

 #### Theory:
 
**1. Ethnographic Fieldwork - Tactile Mapping**
Observing and engaging with people’s habits and interactions with urban environments to understand spatial use and social dynamics (Emotional cartography body+space (movements/feelings)) + Documenting daily tactile encounters; exploring patterns, emotional responses, and spatial relationships to touch.

**2. Interviews**
Gathering data on the specific contexts of:
- Smart-textiles interactions (Irmandy Wicaksono (weaving connections through e-fabrics))
- Wearables (Katrina Jungnickel)
- Metabolic materials (?)
- New forms of interactions in Smart cities (Senseable City Rio - UFRJ (smart sensing cities))
- The Future of Skin and Touch (Lucy McRae)
- Touch and Skin (General public)

**3. Critical Theory**
Analyzing fashion's social, cultural, and bonding implications to the urban space and how to augment those by tactile wearable interfaces (haptics).



#### Practice:

**1. Practice/Experimental-Based Research**
Fashion/electronic hacking to experiment with speculative narratives, creating future-oriented wearables to engage with the sense of touch and study audience response.

**2. Material Exploration**
Investigating textures, materials, and surfaces through through testing and prototyping tactile wearable interfaces (haptics). 
    - Analyzing common forms and patterns,  fabrication techniques, and structural innovations.
    - Exploring Metabolic fabrics (growing materials)




 ### Summer Planing:

  - Readings (June - Sept)
  - Writings (June - Oct)
  - Observations exercises (July- August)
  - Interviews (June - Sept)

### PRESENTATION
* 10min
* 5 slides:
    - Topic and research question
    - References/Methodology (examples of fields you want to develop your project/context - and frame the methodology, how do you plan to work?)
    - Graphic design choices (printed book/ form and content of your project - the physical aspect should guide the form) - Fingerprint QR-code
    - Schedule/Goals

## INTERVIEWS
- Who are the local experts on the topic?
- How can I contact these people?
- Does anyone know them to help me setup the interview?
- Can I find their contact online?
- Learning as much as you can about the person/topic before the interview can help you create specific questions on your interview subject (reframe questions)
- Doing research about the interviewee's past experience on your topic or any texts they have written is great background research.
- Antecipate/understand your interviewee's surroundings to be prepared
- Be clear about the goal of the interview before writing the questions

#### PLAN A PROGRESSION (from general to more specific)
    - Use descriptive questions
    - Specific questions (for the interviweer's practice)
    - Sub-questions
    - Give people convidence and keep the conversation flowing

            1. (general/small-talk)   How did you start working on automated photography?
            2. (Sub-personal-question)   Do you post photos from the game to your Instagram account (descriptive questions/their practices)?
            3. (Specific questions) Can you tell about your project "xxx", in particular how you created this striking parallel between the film "yyy" and computer-generated image worlds?
            4. (speculative)   Can you envision how this automatic generated pictures will evolve to change the way we engage with memories?


#### PREPARE FUTURE-ORIENTED QUESTIONS
  - At the end, give space for speculation/previsions


#### BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS:
- Begin with some small talk and general questions
- Make sure to say how much time you are going to take (timing)
- Explain the focus of the interview
- Be clear about your intention and the time it takes
- Sometimes is good to give the questions before the interview so they can prepare

#### ONCE YOU BEGIN:
- Take good notes and ask for permission
- Take notes/record
- ask open-ended questions (don't write "yes/no" questions, you should help people keep talking)
- Keep the conversation moving
    - Can you tell me a bit more/develop about that?
    - ask follow up questions
- Let silence happen (it gives users time to think)
- Always ask why when something interesting comes up

#### AT THE END
- Make sure to say you may reach for them again
