# HABITAT - PROJECTS REFERENCES
  
## 🧬Neri Oxman – Material Ecology
- Oxman’s work dissolves boundaries between structure and skin, creating multi-material, biologically inspired systems that adapt like organisms.

- In Wanderers or Silk Pavilion, she imagines garments and habitats that are grown rather than built, integrating biomechanics, fabrication, and function.

- Relevance: Inspires how soft structures might breathe, grow, or evolve, turning clothing and architecture into symbiotic ecosystems.


## 🧠Lucy McRae – Body Architect
- Her practice explores futuristic intimacy, sensory isolation, and architectures of emotion—with wearable pods, protective exo-skins, or sensorial chambers that house the body.

- Works like The Future Day Spa or Compression Cradle question how environments might affect the psyche through touch and soft pressure.

- Relevance: Imagines habitats as intimate companions, questioning care, control, and how architecture feels.


## 🪶Rachel Armstrong – Living Architecture
- Works with protocells and self-repairing materials to imagine buildings that grow, adapt, and decompose—alive in their own right.

- Her designs advocate for biological, metabolic buildings that challenge fixed structures and propose a soft, ecological paradigm.

- Relevance: Grounds your speculative habitats in living processes, connecting skin-like textiles to responsive, dynamic ecosystems.


## 🏚️Philip Beesley – Hylozoic Series
- The Hylozoic Ground experimental architecture series developed by architect Philip Beesley has been expanded and refined by researchers, engineers and designers from around the world. It is an immersive, interactive environment that moves and breathes around its viewers, creating an environment can ‘feel’ and ‘care’. Next-generation artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and interactive technology create an environment that is nearly alive.


## 🌿 Soft Architecture / Pneumatic Design
- Historically includes practices like Ant Farm, Haus-Rucker-Co, and Archigram, who envisioned inflatable, mobile, and playful environments.

- Think of architecture not as fixed but as wearable, inflatable, ephemeral—suggesting futures where shelter is reactive, portable, and intimate.

- Relevance: Invites speculative futures where garments become rooms, and rooms become skins that breathe.
