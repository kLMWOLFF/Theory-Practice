### Neri Oxman – Material Ecology
- Aguahoja I (Biopolymer pavilion) - Organic structures embody more efficient and adaptable material properties compared with human-made ones, and leave no environmental marks. From a limited palette of molecular components, including cellulose, chitin, and pectin―the very same materials found in trees, crustaceans and apple skins―natural systems construct an extensive array of functional materials with no synthetic parallels. These renewable and biocompatible polymers leverage the power of natural resource cycles and can be materially ‘programed’ to decay as they return to the earth, for purposes of fueling new growth.

- Oᵒ project - One material. One biome. From bacteria to bacteria
Can products grow and decompose as ecosystems? Can we design the life cycles of consumer goods to borrow matter and energy from Nature and return them upon obsolescence? We present a revolutionary class of biologically programmed, computationally grown, and robotically manufactured shoes and textiles that give biodegradable bioplastics the design that their biology deserves.


### Lucy McRae – Speculative Body. Sci-Fi Artist
- Future Sensitive™ - worldbuilds apparel to forge a state of readiness – addressing gaps between the speed at which technology is advancing, and culture’s preparedness.

- Delicate Spells of Mind - Delicate Spells of Mind switches between two worlds: that of ‘Seeker’ and ‘Other’: a dashboard of gadgets and controllers calculate “best” outcome, anything to swerve worldly pain and error. Designed to invite multiple interpretations, Delicate Spells of Mind approaches the spectator as a malleable subject for change and self-reflection, allowing for higher states of consciousness, where humanity, science, ethics, technology shapeshift, integrate and unite.

- Body Architect - From images of augmented bodies and wild flights of biological fancy to an algorithm that makes your face “perfect”, asks how technology is changing our bodies. “The gap between sci-fi and sci-fact is shrinking.”

- Solitary Survival Raft
Toy like switches control an air pump that inflates and deflates a membrane, creating a buffer between the occupant and the world. With the machines' help, human and machine team together becoming fictional conservationists; her body a sort of seed vault and storage facility preserving the very sense that's under threat – touch
Shelter built for a single individual, feeling out and enduring the waves of a hyperreal disruptive time 

- Future Survival Kit
Compression Carpet is part of Lucy’s Future Survival Kit – new kinds of deeply immersive tools for the future, designed as antidotes to our submissive nature towards technology.

- Institute of Isolation
Institute of Isolation is an observational documentary. The film’s protagonist (played by artist Lucy McRae) moves through a series of sensory chambers, spending time in an anechoic chamber examining the psychoacoustics of silence, and in a microgravity trainer conditioning the body for possible life in space. These fictional locations are used to make architectural inquiries into the role buildings could have on altering human biology on an evolutionary scale.

- Heavy Duty Love for Future Sensitive Humans - 
Technology and touch is at the centre of an installation exploring the comfort of the embrace — fueling important dialogue on the complex future realities of human connection. Heavy Duty Love is a mental health prop existent as a tactile mechanical structure, asking, “As we head toward a life designed from scratch, will we seek new types of intimacy?”

- Compression Cradle - Compression Cradle is a machine that affectionately squeezes the body with a sequence of aerated volumes that hold you tight –  in an attempt to prepare the self for a future that assumes a lack of human touch.

- LucyandBart - Lucyandbart is a photographic collaboration between Lucy and Bart Hess, generating imagery exploring how the human silhouette may evolve. The ad hoc duo worked close to the body, imagining the skin could sprout gills, becoming ecological skins, where textiles grow from skin pores and gender becomes fluid. 

- Future Day Spa - 2015. Science Fiction Wellness – Replicating the feeling of being hugged, audiences temporarily hand their bodies over to a part–human, part–machine process that induces the body into a state of relaxation.

### Iris Van Herpen & Philip Beesley 
- The Hylozoic Ground experimental architecture series developed by architect Philip Beesley has been expanded and refined by researchers, engineers and designers from around the world. It is an immersive, interactive environment that moves and breathes around its viewers, creating an environment can ‘feel’ and ‘care’. Next-generation artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, and interactive technology create an environment that is nearly alive.
- Sensory Seas: Morphogenesis Dress (Iris Van Herpen collaboration Paris, FR  2020)
Sensory Seas aims to highlight the nuances between the anthropology of a marine organism and the role of dendrites and synapses delivering signals throughout our own bodies. 
- Magnetic Motion collection, presented at Centre Pompidou for Paris Fashion Week on September 30. Supported by advanced computational modeling and industrial design, the collaborators’ innovative designs combine precisely detailed polymer, crystal and leather components into interlinking three-dimensional fabric structures with striking qualities of flexibility, sparkle and transparency.
- Voltage Haute Couture

### OPAVIVARÁ!
- art collective from Rio de Janeiro, which develops actions in public spaces of the city, galleries and cultural institutions, offering inversions in the use of urban space through the creation of relational devices that provide collective experiences
    - Formosa Decelerator, 2014
    - "Print Skin" highlights the traditional rituals of the indigenous communities of Brazil, in which people decorate their bodies with various patterns significant to their cultures. As a kind of stamp, the work allows the public to mark their own skin with the impressions of animals, thus assuming the spiritual powers of these and absorb their natural forces.
