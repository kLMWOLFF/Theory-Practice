 ## Habitat

 ### 1. Terms/Topics: 
 
- **Data Bending:** Manipulating digital files (like images or audio) by editing their raw data to create unexpected, glitchy effects.

- **Circuit Bending:** The creative short-circuiting of electronic devices, like toys or synthesizers, to produce new, unpredictable sounds or behaviors.

- **Cradle to Grave:** A product life cycle concept tracking materials and impact from creation to disposal.

- **Wild Tech:** Technologies that behave unpredictably or adaptively, often inspired by nature rather than strictly controlled engineering.

- **Multi-sensory Experiences:** Experiences designed to engage multiple senses (sight, touch, hearing, smell, taste) for richer interaction.

- **Digital Twin:** A virtual replica of a real-world object, system, or environment used for monitoring, simulation, or analysis.

- **Dual-reality (physical and virtual worlds):** Systems that link physical environments with digital counterparts, allowing real-time interaction between the two.

- **Telepresence Technology:** Tools that let users experience and interact with remote locations as if they were physically present, often using robotics or VR.

- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):** The study and design of how people interact with computers and digital systems.

- **Emotional Design:** Creating products and experiences that evoke emotional responses, enhancing connection and satisfaction.

- **Sustainability:** Designing and acting in ways that meet present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs.

- **Living Elements (Biological) Fabrication:** Using biological organisms or processes (like bacteria, fungi, or plants) to create materials or products.

- **Wearable Computing:** Technology integrated into clothing or accessories that provides computing power and connectivity on the go.

- **Wearable Systems:** Integrated combinations of technology and clothing/accessories designed for sensing, communication, or enhancement.

- **Sensors:** Devices that detect and respond to physical inputs from the environment (like light, motion, or temperature).

- **Interfaces:** Points of interaction between humans and machines, enabling communication and control (e.g., screens, buttons, gestures).

- **Social Science:** The study of human society, relationships, and behaviors.

- **Performance:** A live artistic expression—such as dance, theater, or interactive installations—that often engages audiences physically or emotionally.

- **Mapping:** The act of creating a visual or conceptual representation of spaces, systems, or data relationships.

- **Human Augmentation:** Technologies that enhance human abilities, such as strength, perception, or cognition.

- **Responsive Environments:** Spaces that react to the presence or actions of people, often through technology like sensors and automation.

- **Digital Craft:** The merging of traditional craft techniques with digital tools or methods to create new forms of handmade work.

- **Skin:** A protective and sensing layer; in design and robotics, it often refers to outer surfaces that can feel, protect, or adapt.

- **Electronic Skins:** Thin, flexible materials embedded with sensors and electronics that mimic the properties of natural skin.

- **Soft Technology/Soft Interaction:** Technologies that are flexible, tactile, and intuitive, encouraging gentle, organic forms of engagement.

- **Textiles:** Flexible materials made from fibers, yarns, or fabrics, used for clothing, decoration, and technical applications.

- **Electronic Textiles (e-textiles):** Fabrics embedded with electronics like sensors or LEDs to enable interactive or responsive behavior.

 ### 2. Research Questions: 
 
 Write a list of questions and analyze it. Combine questions, try explaning some with more questions.

 1. What new forms of interaction can e-skins and wearable systems create, that feel soft, emotional, and intuitive?

 2. What role can living biological fabrication play in designing sustainable evolving Garments that can live multiple lives across physical and virtual worlds?

 3. How do garments that sense and respond to their surroundings reshape our understanding of the body (skin) as a boundary?

 4. How can e-skins and wild tech generate new fashion bodies, where garments breathe, sense, and mutate?

 5. What would it feel like to move through responsive environments that rewrite themselves in real time, controled by augmenting soft robotic skins?

 6. In what ways can touch, through augmented skins, serve as a language of connection in hybrid habitats?

 7. How might textiles become living mediators of touch between physical and virtual environments?

 8. What happens to our sense of self when the skin we wear is no longer fixed, but evolving, layered, and reactive?

 9. What would it be like to co-live with semi-autonomous garments?

 10. What kinds of ecosystems are formed when garments become living, growing, and decomposing agents?

 11. How do reactive garments negotiate what is shown, hidden, or revealed  
        / How e-textiles might blur or amplify bodily presence—revealing mood, status, data—or conversely shielding it?
------------
**Main Questions:**

1. What happens to our sense of self when the skin we wear is no longer fixed, but evolving, layered, and reactive?

2. In which way can augmented skins change the way we use touch as a new language or performative/communicative tool in hybrid habitats?

3. How e-textiles might blur or amplify bodily - negotiating what is shown, hidden, or revealed?

### Framework: 

**Research into Design**
- History of textile
- Aesthetic/Perceptual of skin (what to hide/what to show)
- History of wardrobes
- Bestiary of specific fashion moulage (sleeves/t-shirt) [Carthography]

**Research through Design**
- Prototyping a skin (runing tests on e-skins)
- black box (INPUT>BLACKBOX>OUTPUT) > translucent box (skin)
- Shape something that have the [singularity] of the creator

- Reconstruction (archeology) of a skin/textile

**Research on Design**
- Propose new projects/designs
- Speculative Design


**HAPHEPHOBIA** = fear being touched

## Theme Iterations

### Skin (The Medium)
- feel
- touch
- Haptics

       **Questions FEEL:**
        - How we appropriate/understand things through Touch?
                - What are the properties of the feeling of touch?
        - What is a pleasent Touch/feel? 
                - What kind of feel attract us?
                - What kind of feel repel us?

       **Questions TOUCH:**
        - How many things do we touch in a day?
        - With what kind of shapes/textures do our skin interact?

       **Questions HAPTICS:**
        - 


### Human Relationships (The Meaning)
- Communication
- Space
- stories
- feelings

       **Questions COMMUNICATION:**
        - In how many ways can we communicate through Touch?
        - 

       **Questions SPACE:**
        - How we percieve the space around us through touch properties?

       **Questions STORIES:**
        - 

       **Questions FEELINGS:**
        - How we percieve the space around us through touch properties?


### Augmented Touch (The )
- Augmented Feel (physical)
- Augmented Feeling (emotional)
- Haptic Poetry

       **Questions AUGMENTED FEEL:**
        - How can we enrich everyday experiences throught touch?
        - How to use touch to root people to the place they are (shared feel)

       **Questions AUGMENTED FEELING:**

        -

       **Questions HAPTIC POETRY:**
        - What is haptic poetry?
        - Memory is sometimes nothing more than sensations, colours, rhythms and sounds that surface in our consciousness
